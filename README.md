# Spring Testing Consumer

This is a dummy application that consumes the API provided by the [Spring Testing](https://github.com/hamvocke/spring-testing) repository.

Upon running the `PersonClientConsumerTest` test, it will generate a new pact file in `target/pacts`. For now this file needs to be copied into the _Spring Testing_ repo's pact directory whenever it's updated. That's good enough for a simple example.
